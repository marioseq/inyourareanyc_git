You'll be greeted with a welcome panel with instructions on how to setup the theme. In summary, this is how setup is handled.
 
1. Upload and activate the theme.

2. Upload the .dat file into PageLines--->Dashboard--->Import/Export. This will set the same layout as the demo. 

3. Set the menu under Logo Section Navigation.

4. Head to the widgets area, and take out all the widgets in the primary sidebar.

5. Slide the archives, and category widgets into the primary sidebar.

6. Done!
